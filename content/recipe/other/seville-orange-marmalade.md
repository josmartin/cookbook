##### Method
Wash the oranges in cold water, then cut fruit and squeeze all juice into a preserving pan. Take out all pips and pith and place into a muslin bag. Slice orange peel finely and put in preserving pan with orange juice and 6 pints of water. Add 1 pint of boiling water to the pips and pith in the muslin bag. Leave all to stand for 24 hours.

Next day, strain all the liquid, jelly and pectin from the muslin bag and add this to the preserving pan. Cook the peel at a very slow simmer until it all is tender (about 1 1/2 hours). Remove from heat and leave to stand for another 24 hours.

Next day, to each pint of pulp add a pound of sugar. Heat gently to make sure all the sugar dissolves then raise the heat & cook fast until it is ready to set (106.5C - test a small amount on a cold plate where it should form a jelly as it cools, and wrinkle to a push). Stand for 5 mins, scraping off any scum on the top (this can be dissipated with a small amount of butter). Pour into hot sterilized jars, cover with wax seal and close off.

This should make 10 - 11lb of marmalade.
