Chop onions and chillies in a food processor and put in preserving pan. Chop out green heads from tomatoes, chop finely in food processor (take care not to puree the tomatoes) and add to preserving pan. Add salt and most of the vinegar to preserving pan. Blend curry and mustard powder with a small amount of the vinegar to form a smooth paste, and add the rest of the ingredients to the preserving pan. Bring to the boil stirring to dissolve the sugar. Then boil hard, stirring occasionally at first and then almost continuously at the end to avoid burning the bottom. Most of the liquid will evaporate in about 1.25 to 1.5 hours, and it will change from a red to a brown colour. Pour into warmed jars and seal immediately. Leave for 4 months to develop.

##### Notes

Normally the chillies are the small dried ones. Use 4-5 Thai hot chillies. You can use fresh chillies. Use a hot curry powder such as Madras.
