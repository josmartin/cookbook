##### Method
Take a sheet of filo pastry, brush with a mixture of melted oil and butter or margarine. Cut in half across the long side to make 2 pieces. Place a small amount of filling in the centre of one end of each piece, fold in the sides over the filling and then roll. Seal the end with a little more of the oil/butter mixture. Brush over the roll with more oil/butter and place on a baking dish. When the baking dish is full or you have made enough, bake at 180°C (350°F, Gas Mark 4) until golden brown. Notes The parcels can be made in advance and kept in a fridge until required.

##### Fillings
* Goats cheese.
* Spinach and ricotta.
* Samosa mix (see Samosa recipe).
