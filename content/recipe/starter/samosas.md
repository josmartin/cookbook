#### Method
Cook the potatoes and allow to cool. Cut them into small dice - about 2cm
square. 

Chop the onions. Peel and finely chop or grate the ginger. Finely chop the
chilli and coriander leaves. Dry roast the coriander seeds and crush.
Heat the oil and fry the onions, ginger and chilli. Add the cooked peas, then
the rest of the ingredients and mix well.
Use filo pastry to make the samosas (see Filo Parcels).

#### Notes
The amount of chilli required will depend on how hot the chilli is and how hot
you like it. Add it gradually and taste to get the right degree of hotness.
Remember that once it is inside the pastry it will be less hot.
The mixture improves with keeping so try to make it a day in advance. It can
also be frozen.

If you do not have coriander seeds use ground coriander instead.
