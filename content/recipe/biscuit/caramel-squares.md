Melt the butter and sugar in a saucepan. Add the tin of condensed milk and
the dried fruit and bring to the boil, stirring constantly to avoid the mixture
catching on the base of the pan and burning. Beat the egg well and stir into
the fruit mixture taking care not to scramble the eggs. Add the vanilla (or
almond) essence and boil for about 2 minutes or until the mixture is
caramel-coloured. Crush the packet of Marie biscuits quite finely using a
food processor if you have one. Stir the biscuit crumbs into the fruit mixture.
Spread the mixture into a well-greased baking tray and leave to cool. When
quite firm, cut into squares.
