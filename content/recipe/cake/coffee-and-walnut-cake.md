### Ingredients
#### Cake
- 1½ Tbsp Instant coffee
- 75 gm Walnuts (3 oz)
- 150 gm Plain flour (6 oz)
- 3 tsp Baking powder
- 150 gm Butter or margarine (6 oz)
- 150 gm Caster sugar (6 oz)
- 3 Egg(s)
#### Syrup
- 1 Tbsp Instant coffee
- 55 ml Water (2 fl oz)
- 50 gm Demerara sugar (2 oz)
#### Filling
- 1 Tbsp Instant coffee
- 1 Tbsp Caster sugar
- 1 Tbsp Walnuts
- 250 gm Mascarpone (9 oz)
- 200 ml Fromage Frais (7 fl oz)
### Method
Pre-heat the oven to 170°C (325°F, Gas Mark 3). Toast all the walnuts by spreading them on a baking tray and placing in the oven for 7 minutes. Take care they do not burn. Reserve a few for decoration if required. Chop the rest. For the cake, mix all the ingrerdients except the coffee, water and walnuts and whisk until you have a smooth well-combined mixture. This will require the butter or margarine to be soft. You can do this in a food processor if preferred. Mix the coffee in the boiling water. Fold the coffee and walnuts into the mixture. Divide the mixture between two 8 inch (20cm) cake tins which have been well-greased and lined on the base with greaseproof paper or baking parchment. Bake for 30 minutes. For the syrup, mix the coffee and sugar and add boiling water stirring until dissolved. For the filling, whisk together all the ingredients except the reserved walnuts and chill until required. When the cakes are cooked, remove from the oven and leaving them in the tins, prick them all over with a skewer or fork while they are still hot. Pour over the syrup as evenly as possible. When they are cold, turn them out and remove the lining paper. Spread half the filling over the first cake, place the second on top and then spread the remaining filling over the top. Decorate with the reserved walnuts. If you are not going to serve the cake immediately, keep it chilled in the fridge until required.
