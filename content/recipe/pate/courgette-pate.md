### Ingredients
- 100 gm Butter (4 oz)
- 300 gm Courgettes (12 oz)
- 4 Spring onions 1 Tbsp Parsley
- 2 Egg(s) Salt
- Black pepper

### Method
Dice the courgettes. Chop the spring onions and parsley finely. Saute the courgettes in half the butter. Add the spring onions and parsley. Put the vegetables into a food processor and puree. Beat the eggs. Put the rest of the butter into the pan and lightly scramble the eggs Add the the courgette mixture and puree again. Put into a greased bowl and chill for at least 2 hours. Serve with toast or biscuits.

### Variation
#### Fresh Pea
Use fresh peas in place of the courgettes and mint instead of parsley. Cook the peas before proceeding as per the recipe. The peas make a much more solid mixture so thin a little with water.

#### Asparagus
Use lightly boiled or steamed asparagus in place of the courgettes.
