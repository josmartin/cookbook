### Ingredients

    4 Tbsp Plain flour
    3 Tbsp Granulated white sugar
    1 Tbsp Butter
    1 l Milk (2 pint)
    2 Egg(s)
    2 tsp Vanilla essence
	
### Method

Heat the oven to 150°C (300°F, Gas Mark 2).
Cream the butter and sugar and then add the flour. The amounts make this
quite difficult but do the best you can. Bring the milk to a boil, taking care not
to burn the milk and stir gradually into the flour mixture avoiding lumps.
Separate the eggs. Add the well beaten egg yolks into the milk together with
the vanilla essence. Beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold into the mixture.
Pour into a lightly buttered oven dish and stand the dish in a pan of cold
water. Grate nutmeg over the top of the pudding and bake until firm and
golden brown.

We serve this warm with a spoonful of golden syrup, but this is optional. It is
also good cold.

##### Notes
If the mixture gets lumpy push it through a sieve and stir until smooth.
