Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (350°F, Gas Mark 4).
Cut the plums, peaches, nectarines, etc in halves or quarters and remove the
stones. Peel, core and slice the apples and pears. Grapes and other soft
fruit can be added whole. Peel the oranges and remove all pith, then cut into
chunks. Place all the fruit in a large baking dish, sprinkle with cinnamon and
add a little water or wine.
Bake until the fruit starts to caramelise.
Serve hot or cold.

##### Notes
The fruit can be frozen and used later. It also keeps very well in the fridge.
Serve it as fruit with cream, ice cream or mascarpone.
Also use it in pies, crumbles or with Grated Pastry.

##### Variation
Use any fruits you like. I have used apricots,mango and pineapple in the
past - in fact any fruits I happen to have.
Use orange juice as some of the liquid.
Add ground ginger and some stem ginger in place of the cinnamon.
