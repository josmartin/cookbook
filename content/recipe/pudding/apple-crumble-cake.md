### Ingredients
- Wholemeal flour 
- Brown sugar
- 200 gm (8 oz) Wholemeal flour

### Method
Heat the oven to 200°C (400°F, Gas Mark 6).
Rub the fat into the flour and baking powder. Add the sugar. This can all be
done in a food processor.
Put half the mixture into a round baking tin (preferrably with a loose base).
Then spoon the cooked apple onto the base leaving a gap at the edge.
Cover with the rest of the crumble mix and gently firm with a spoon. Bake in
a hot oven until golden brown. Serve hot or cold.

### Notes

The crumble mix can be used just as a topping to any fruit if required.
