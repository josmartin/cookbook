#### Method
Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F, Gas Mark 2).
Heat the milk until a skin forms on the surface (ie scald the milk). Beat the
egss and sugar until frothy, then add the vanilla essence and milk, beating
well to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the mixture into a greased
baking dish. Grate a little nutmeg over the pudding. Stand the dish in a
pan/dish of cold water and bake until set.
