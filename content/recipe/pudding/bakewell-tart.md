Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F, Gas Mark 6).
First line a flan dish with shortcrust pastry - see recipe for Shortcrust Pastry
or buy ready made. Spread a thin layer of raspberry (or other) jam over the
base of the pastry. Cream the butter or margarine and sugar and then
gradually beat in the eggs until fluffy. Add the ground almonds and the
almond essence and beat well. Spoon the mixture over the pastry. Bake for
30 to 40 minutes.

##### Notes
The top tends to get very brown or burn so check it and turn down the oven
temperature if necessary.
